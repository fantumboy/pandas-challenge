It appears that overall, when spending less per student and decreasing school size, average scores and passing rates increase (inverse relationship so to speak). This would make sense as student to teacher ratio would be lower/better and more attention can be given to students to succeed. 

One of the conclusions that could be made, and is confirmed by the numbers, is that charter schools do very well (top five highest performing schools are charter schools and the top lowest are district schools). An interesting comparison is the wide disparity in percent passing across the board between charter and district schools, yet, the percent overall passing rate sits at just over 65%.
